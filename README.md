Expat_one
This is the repo for the landing and about page of the expat_one blogging app.

This app was styled with Less. all Less files were imported in the index.less file.
I used less variables and mixins that can be found in mix-var.less
Fontawesome was used. for the header and footer links as well as the button.
The images were aquired by a google images search for beach, travel, and thailand.
